# Weekly Update 1
Each team member came up with a list of project ideas on their own. We then met up to discuss these as a team and scope out feasibility of each idea. Additionally, as a team we discussed personal goals for our project and technologies we hoped to use.

During class and lab, we got input and suggestions from the professor and TAs and were able to narrow down our project to either an animal health tracking device or a compact pill dispensing device.
For next week, we hope to have finalized our project idea and established an implementation plan for it. Over the weekend, we will perpare our project proposal presentation for class on Tuesday
