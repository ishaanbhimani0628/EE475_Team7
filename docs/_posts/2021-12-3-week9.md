# Weekly Update 9

The project is coming together! The whole team met on Tuesday to start integrating modules. Ishaan and Hafsa were able to successfully send orientation data from the collar to the base station, and were able to read RSSI values between the two. Furthermore, Ishaan and Tanpreet were able to successfully send data over BLE from the base station to the phone app. Individual contributions are listed below.

Ishaan: Ishaan completed the PCB for the collar and ordered the PCB and associated parts. The PCB may arrive later than the demo, but can still be used for a recorded demo. Furthermore, he wrote the base station code for reading RSSI values and connecting to both the phone and the collar over BLE.

Hafsa: Hafsa solved some bugs for the SPI communication the accelerometer, as well as identified the (rather peculiar) data scheme for the accelerometer. She started calibrating the accelerometer to idenfity the drinking orientation for the collar.

Tanpreet: Tanpreet continued work on the app and implemented bluetooth connection on the app.
