# Weekly Update 8

As the quarter starts coming to a close, we are nearing our goals. This week, the group worked on a project status update presentation. Other contributions were individual and are listed below.

Hafsa: Since the collar has base functionality of bluetooth transmission and accelerometer reading, Hafsa worked on starting a PCB for the collar. She also started calibrating the acceleromter values for determining if the animal is drinking or not.

Ishaan: Ishaan worked on software development for the base station. He successfully was able to connect to and receive data from the HM-10 module that the collar will be using. In the upcoming week, he will complete the PCB for the collar and implement RSSI for the base station.

Tanpreet: Tanpreet continued work on the mobile app, and is working on bluetooth integration.

The team plans to meet early in the week to integrate their individual efforts. The product is starting to come together!
