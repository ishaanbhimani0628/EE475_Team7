# Weekly Update 6
This week, we created a kickstarter page for our project. During this time, we were able to reevaluate potential risks and goals for our project in the upcoming weeks. 

Additionally, this week, Ishaan and Hafsa interfaced the EZ430 with the ADXL362 accelerometer over SPI. Ishaan was also able to complete a power calculation on the collar. Tanpreet worked on app development. 

Individual contributions are below:

Ishaan: Ishaan worked on getting SPI set up with the EZ430 and tested using an oscilloscope. When the SPI implementation with the accelerometer was not sending the data correctly, Ishaan was successfully able to debug this using suggestions from Brody (TA). Additionally, Ishaan completed a power calculation on the collar. He selected and ordered parts for a 3.3V boost switching regulator to power the collar from AA batteries, and is working on implementing circuit.

Hafsa: Hafsa ordered new components that the team confirmed for the base station.

Tanpreet: Tanpreet worked on designing the mobile application. One is now able to add animals to their account and see them displayed in the app. 

In the next week, Hafsa and Ishaan plan to have the PCB Board design for the collar, successfully set up bluetooth communication between the collar and base station, and implement the bluetooth and accelerometer for the collar to work simultaneously. Tanpreet plans to integrate bluetooth with the app.
