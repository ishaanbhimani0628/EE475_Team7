# Weekly Update 10

This was the final week of the project! We are proud of what we have learned and accomplished. As a team, we tested our integrated project and presented our final demo. The testing consisted of finishing soldering and testing the PCB. We ran into a couple bugs that we perservererd through to fix. Firstly, when desoldering some pin headers from the accelerometer we broke some traces on the breakout board. Ishaan and Hafsa worked to expose the copper traces on the breakout board and solder straight to them. We also noticed that the TX and Rx traces on the PCB were flipped. This was by design, since we thought that we could easily change the GPIO pins of the software UART in software, but this proved false.

Individiual contributions are below:

Hafsa: Hafsa started work on the final report and kickstarter, updated the PRD, and edited the demo video used for our final presentation. She also soldered the pin headers to the PCB and designed the wearable component of the collar. 

Ishaan: Ishaan soldered the power stage components to the PCB and made final changes to the base station code. He also put together the slides for our final presentation. 

Tanpreet: Tanpreet finalized the mobile application.
