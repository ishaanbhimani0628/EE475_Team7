    <h1>Weekly Lab Notebook</h1>
    <h3>October 2 to October 8</h3>
    <p>Each team member came up with a list of ideas on their own. We then met up to discuss these as a team and scope out feasibility of each idea. Additionally, as a team we discussed personal goals for our project and technologies we hoped to use. </p>

    <p>During class and lab, we got input and suggestions from the professor and TAs and were able to narrow down our project to either an animal health tracking device or a compact pill dispensing device.</p>
