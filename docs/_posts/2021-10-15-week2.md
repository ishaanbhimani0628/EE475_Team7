# Weekly Update 2
At the beginning of the week, we all met to finalize our project idea, an animal hydration tracker. We then worked on our project proposal, which included a rough outline of our design solutions, resources needed, and demo goals. Yesterday, we got feedback on our [design plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfo5EyOaAEFZO6UMfNLCSB3R0pztV9E66vYbgbZcUJg/edit?usp=sharing) from Shwetak and the TAs and started looking into the specific microcontrollers and parts we wanted to use for our project. Additional individual updates can be found below.  

Hafsa: Met with farm animal owners last weekend to discuss what were the causes of the most common issues in farm animals and what data would be beneficial to help prevent these issues. 
Ishaan: Set up and formatted the website and added project proposal summary/abstract to the website.

By next week, we plan to have parts ordered and our Product Requirements Document completed. We also plan to start working on implementing the device that will be on the animal.
